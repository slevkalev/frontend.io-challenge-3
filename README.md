## My process

I built this project almost completely with just functions and then I saw a video by Dcode on youtube that made a keyboard as a javascript object. I thought that it was the cleaner way to make this project.  However I was confused about the EventHandler part of the object so I think there is something I need to learn.  I did not play with the desktop design themes so much because I already spent too much time on this project remaking it.  I did manage to get the toggle and all 3 themes working. And I made it somewhat responsive.

here's the link to the video:

### Built with

vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS

### What I learned

working with an object to create this project rather than just functions.

### Continued development

I used minimal HTML in the index.html file becuase I constructed the calculator with javascript in 
_init() function of the object
### Useful resources

watched a dcode youtube video to help me make this project.  video link is up above
